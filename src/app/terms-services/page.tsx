                  among the nilDB nodes of the Nillion Network and in its
                  current beta state Nillion operates all nodes. Your content is
                  not used for model training, analytics, or any other secondary
                  processing. Where we can access User Content we treat this as
                  confidential and do not by default inspect the content of your
                  prompts or files. No date is stored in a TEE after processing.
