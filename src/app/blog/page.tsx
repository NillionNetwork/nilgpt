                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      One of the most requested features has arrived. nilGPT now
                      supports web search, made possible by a new capability
                      recently introduced in nilAI. This capability is powered
                      by Brave's API, chosen for its stronger privacy
                      protections.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      By default, web search is turned off in nilGPT - you'll
                      need to toggle it on to use it. When enabled, please be
                      aware that sensitive query data may be visible to Brave
                      servers. While nilAI's optimisation pipeline summarises
                      queries before sending them, we cannot guarantee that all
                      sensitive information is stripped away. We are in fact
                      working on an "AI proxy" to remove or anonymise PII from
                      queries which would increase the privacy of the websearch
                      feature even more.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                      For now, web search is limited to 20 queries per user per
                      day as we refine performance and gather your feedback.
                      Even in this early stage, it extends nilGPT's reach beyond
                      its training data, pulling in fresh answers and
                      information directly from the web.

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      We've also added support for secure PDF uploads, allowing
                      you to drop in documents and query them directly in
                      nilGPT.

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                      Initially this feature was designed to accelerate
                      workflows for professionals who handle large volumes of
                      text - from legal contracts to academic research. But it's
                      just as valuable for everyday use cases, like quickly
                      checking an employment agreement for key clauses you
                      should pay close attention to. These are exactly the kinds
                      of scenarios where truly private AI shows its worth,
                      delivering both security and convenience.

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                      As always, we have also fixed a number of bugs and
                      introduced small quality-of-life improvements to keep the
                      overall experience smooth.

                      commitment to privacy. We're particularly interested to
                      see how industry professionals adopt PDF analysis in their

                  step closer toward building the most privacy-preserving and

                    Two weeks ago, we shipped attestation flows, giving you the
                    ability to verify that nilGPT is running exactly the code we
                    open-sourced. Last week, we rolled out the PWA, so you can
                    install nilGPT directly on your mobile device for a more

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      The first big upgrade is the introduction of Gemma 3 27B,
                      a state-of-the-art model that significantly increases the
                      power of nilGPT. As a reminder, all of our models run on
                      bare-metal servers inside TEEs (trusted execution
                      environments). That means there is no reliance on
                      third-party clouds, no hidden data pipelines, and the same
                      uncompromising privacy guarantees we've promised from day
                      one. With Gemma 3 27B, you get stronger reasoning, more
                      detailed answers, and faster performance—all while keeping
                      your data fully secure.

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      The second major feature is the ability to upload images.
                      For the first time, nilGPT can handle images as well as
                      text. You can now upload screenshots, diagrams, or photos
                      and interact with them directly in nilGPT.

                      rename chats, giving you more control over your chat
                      history. On the landing page, a new counter shows the
                      total number of messages sent with nilGPT since launch—a
                      small but satisfying reminder of how quickly the community

                  <em>
                    TL;DR: nilGPT is now open source and comes with
                    attestations. This means you can now verify the code running
                    matches the published repository.

                <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Two weeks ago we launched the first version of nilGPT with a
                  clear mission: to give people a truly private option when
                  using AI chatbots. This is important as most AI services today
                  are not private by design—users are handing over their
                  sensitive data and thoughts with no guarantees about how that
                  information will be used or who may see it in the future.

                    Still, claiming privacy on its own isn't enough. Anybody can
                    claim that their service is private.
                  </p>

                  <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    We are taking all of the necessary steps to prove that our
                    service is private by introducing a layer of verifiable
                    trust to nilGPT, making it possible for anyone to confirm
                    that nilGPT is behaving exactly as promised.

                  <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Why should this matter to you? Because open source alone
                    isn't a guarantee.

                  <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    nilGPT could, in theory, run different code in the
                    background. Attestations close that gap, giving you a way to
                    check that the code running nilGPT is the same code
                    published in the repository. That means you don't just have
                    to trust us—you can verify it yourself.

                      This release also gives users the ability to see and

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      Attestations are cryptographic proofs generated by TEEs.
                      They act like a seal of authenticity, proving that the
                      program inside the TEE, or the TEE itself, have not been
                      tampered with. The key part of the attestation that we are
                      exposing in this release is the measurement hash.

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      You can think of a measurement hash like a fingerprint for
                      software. When the TEE starts up, it takes the code and
                      configuration that will run inside it, and creates a
                      unique cryptographic fingerprint (the hash).

                      <li>
                        If the hash matches the hash produced from the open
                        source repository, you know the code hasn't been
                        altered.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                      As of this release, the measurement hash generated in the
                      TEE can be fetched by the user directly on nilGPT meaning

                      <li>
                        See the measurement hash generated in nilCC (the TEE).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Compare it with a pre-computed hash (generated from the
                        open-source repository).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If the two match, you can be confident the TEE is
                        running exactly the same code as the open-source nilGPT.
                      </li>

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      This is a big step toward verifiable trust as it removes
                      the need to just trust that the code running is the code
                      from the open sourced repository.

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      Note that currently, the pre-computed hash of the open
                      source code base is exactly that: pre-computed by us. In
                      future versions, we will give anyone the ability to easily
                      generate this hash independently, further strengthening
                      trust and transparency.

                      Every day, millions of users pour their most sensitive
                      information into these systems - proprietary code,
                      personal medical concerns, financial data - and even use
                      them as their therapist. We're witnessing the construction
                      of perhaps the largest unregulated repository of private
                      information in history, controlled by a handful of
                      entities with opaque governance structures.

                      The parallels to other data catastrophes are striking.

                      Upload your DNA, get ancestry insights; its a no-brainer.
                      Fast-forward to today: the company faces bankruptcy, and
                      that genetic data becomes a commodity in the liquidation
                      process. The assumption should be not if, but when the
                      datasets being amassed behind modern user-friendly AI
                      tools will be leaked.

                      The asymmetry is stark. With modern AI tools, users
                      experience immediate, tangible benefits while privacy
                      costs are deferred, irreversible, and invisible until it's
                      too late.

                      This isn't sustainable. Privacy-conscious users and
                      advocates, in particular, should recognise that we need
                      architecturally sound alternatives - not because everyone
                      requires maximum privacy all the time, but because having
                      that option should be a fundamental right and not a
                      luxury.

                      The path forward isn't to abandon AI; instead, we must
                      build choice into the system. We envision a world where
                      cutting-edge AI handles everyday tasks, but
                      privacy-preserving alternatives exist for sensitive
                      moments. This isn't about paranoia, it is about having
                      options when they matter most. This is why we decided to
                      build our own private AI chat - nilGPT.

                      When we started architecting nilGPT, we deliberately
                      avoided the incrementalist approach. Instead of asking
                      "how can we make existing systems slightly more private,"
                      we asked "what would a genuinely private AI system look

                      It is clear that the demand for private AI is growing and
                      many are attempting to solve it. Below, we consider some

                          Running models locally is theoretically ideal - users
                          have complete control, there are zero external
                          dependencies and maximum privacy is achieved as data
                          never leaves the users device. However, the practical
                          constraints are often severe. High-quality models
                          require substantial computational resources that most
                          users simply don't have. There is also a high
                          technical barrier for users to get set up meaning most
                          will never be able to get beyond this phase. Also,
                          with a purely local approach users may forego
                          persistent storage across different devices - a
                          significant UX drawback. In conclusion, while for the
                          most technically able, the local approach is almost
                          certainly the best with respect to privacy, it is not
                          a universal, scalable solution for everyone.

                          Many services tout privacy while running architectures

                          Common patterns include third-party cloud integration
                          with unclear encryption guarantees, or simply
                          policy-based privacy ("we promise not to look") around
                          data storage or inference. Many of these solutions
                          have state-of-the-art models and functionality.
                          However, this is largely due to having no added
                          privacy benefits beyond ChatGPT and comparables. These
                          approaches fail the verifiability requirement - they
                          rely on trust instead of technical guarantees. In
                          fact, the situation is worse. They mislead users into

                          fact they're just accepting new terms and conditions.
                          This false sense of security encourages more sensitive
                          use, increasing the damage of possible future data

                          unfortunately, fundamentally misunderstands the
                          privacy problem. When a user inputs sensitive

                          proprietary code, and so on), that content is

                          the provider's servers. The fact that they don't
                          associate it with your email address is irrelevant.
                          The sensitive data itself has already been exposed
                          during inference. This is privacy theatre that
                          conflates identity correlation with data exposure and

                            can access execution logs or user data. nilCC runs a
                            secure enclave (TEE) on a bare metal server, meaning
                            that all the standard protections of TEEs apply, and

                            OpenAI-compatible RESTful API. Models served in
                            nilAI are loaded into a hardware-protected enclave

                          and meaningless without the passphrase. At the same
                          time, secret sharing ensures that no individual node
                          can reconstruct the data even if the passphrase is
                          leaked to the nodes.

                          While nilGPT provides a strong baseline of security
                          (via encryption, MPC, and TEEs) and some verifiability
                          (as any standard browser can be used to inspect the
                          client-side code to verify it encrypts the chat
                          history), several trust assumptions remain. These are
                          known limitations - the result of prioritising a fast
                          release to deliver a private AI service as quickly as
                          possible. Our roadmap includes steps to address and
                          mitigate each of these.

                              The nilGPT backend and nilAI both run inside

                              Environment (TEE) on bare-metal servers. This
                              setup provides standard TEE protections, ensuring
                              that no third-party cloud provider can access logs
                              or outputs. However, attestation reports from

                              components - are not currently available to end

                      In this article, we introduced nilGPT, outlined our design
                      criteria and goals, shared our perspective on alternative
                      approaches to private AI, and examined the architecture
                      along with the remaining trust assumptions.

                      While there is still work to be done, we are actively
                      addressing each of these assumptions. We believe it is
                      important to make the product available now, as even in
                      its current form, we believe nilGPT sets a new benchmark
                      for private AI.

                    <p className="text-navy-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      Looking ahead, our roadmap goes beyond mitigating the
                      trust assumptions. We are focused on expanding
                      capabilities with larger and more powerful multimodal
                      models, integrated web search, voice note functionality,
                      and token-gated features that position the NIL token as a
