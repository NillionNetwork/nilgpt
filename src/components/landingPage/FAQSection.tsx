      question:
        "Where does my chat history get stored and can anyone see my chat history?",
      answer: (
        <>
          No. Your chats are stored in nilDB, a decentralised set of nodes, run
          by distinct entities, where data can be secret-shared and stored under
          Multi-Party Computation (MPC). The MPC storage ensures that no single
          node can reconstruct the data; each only holds a meaningless share of
          the conversation. Even if multiple nodes are compromised, the
          cryptographic properties ensure data remains protected. If one (or
          more) nodes are fully exposed, no user conversations are made public.
          A user’s chats are only ever reconstructed when the user is logged
          into the app.

      question:
        "What’s the difference between nilGPT and other private AI providers?",
      answer:
        "nilGPT offers provable privacy, not just promises. Many other providers rely on trust-based policies or opaque encryption claims, nilGPT runs inference inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) using nilAI and stores chats in nilDB, a decentralised MPC-secured database.",
    },
    {
      question: "What AI models are used in nilGPT?",
      answer:
        "Currently the gpt-oss-20b and gemma-3-27b-it models are used in nilGPT, however we are continuously evaluating which models provide the best accuracy and latency.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data used to train the models?",
      answer:
        "No. Your data is not used to train nilGPT’s models. Your data is only visible to you in the frontend of the app and is always stored under MPC across nilDB nodes.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can the AI model see the questions I ask?",
      answer:
        "No. The AI model itself cannot see your questions. When you use nilGPT, your prompts are processed inside a secure hardware-protected environment (a Trusted Execution Environment, or TEE) via nilAI. This means your input is never exposed to the host system, operators, or any external observer. The model runs entirely within this private enclave, and only you ever see the input and output.",
